# Search modes

`discrawl search` has three modes. FTS is the default and works with no embeddings.

## Modes

- **`fts`** (default) - searches the local SQLite FTS5 index, returns newest matching messages first
- **`semantic`** - embeds the query, scores against locally stored message vectors; errors out cleanly if embeddings are disabled or no compatible vectors exist
- **`hybrid`** - runs FTS and semantic, deduplicates by message id, falls back to FTS when semantic is unavailable

## FTS details

- backed by SQLite FTS5 with the default `unicode61` tokenizer
- user query terms are parameterized and quoted before `MATCH`, so tokens like `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `NEAR`, and `*` are searched as input terms instead of FTS operators
- punctuation still follows FTS5 tokenization rules
- by default, `search` skips rows with no searchable content (attachment text, attachment filenames, embeds, and replies still count as content); use `--include-empty` to opt back in

## Semantic and hybrid prerequisites

- `[search.embeddings]` configured in `~/.discrawl/config.toml`
- local `message_embeddings` rows for the configured provider, model, and input version
- input version is currently `message_normalized_v1`, so vectors are tied to normalized message text rather than raw Discord payloads

Two-phase embedding creation:

1. `discrawl sync --with-embeddings` queues changed messages by writing `embedding_jobs` rows. New messages, changed normalized text, and messages without an existing job are queued. This phase does not call the embedding provider.
2. `discrawl embed` drains pending jobs in bounded batches, calls the configured provider, and writes vectors to `message_embeddings`.

## Provider/model identity

The provider/model/input-version identity is stored on each job and vector. If you change provider or model, pending jobs are retargeted to the new identity and prior attempts are reset. Existing vectors for another identity remain in SQLite, but semantic search only reads vectors compatible with the current config.

Use `--rebuild` when changing provider, model, or input settings and you want to regenerate vectors for the existing archive.

## Local vs remote providers

Local providers like Ollama keep both message and query embedding on the same machine. With remote providers (OpenAI, etc.), message text is sent during `discrawl embed`, and search query text is sent when using `--mode semantic` or `--mode hybrid`. Stored message text is not sent during local vector scoring.

## Examples

```bash
discrawl search "panic: nil pointer"
discrawl search --mode fts "panic: nil pointer"
discrawl search --mode semantic "missing launch checklist"
discrawl search --mode hybrid "database timeout"
discrawl search --guild 123456789012345678 "payment failed"
discrawl search --dm "launch checklist"
discrawl search --channel billing --author steipete --limit 50 "invoice"
discrawl search --include-empty "GitHub"
discrawl --json search "websocket closed"
```
