# Security

## Tokens and credentials

- Do not commit bot tokens or API keys.
- Default config lives in your home directory, not inside the repo.
- Prefer env vars or the OS keyring for bot tokens.
- `discrawl doctor` reports the token source (env or keyring), not token contents.

## Wiretap is local-only

`wiretap` reads local Discord Desktop cache files only. It does not:

- extract, store, or print Discord auth tokens
- use a user token
- call the Discord API as your user
- run as a selfbot

Wiretap DM messages stay local. They are stored under the synthetic guild id `@me` and are never exported to:

- `publish` (Git snapshot output)
- `subscribe` / Git snapshot import
- the optional `--with-embeddings` snapshot export

A shared guild mirror refresh does not wipe local wiretap DM search either - import preserves existing local `@me` guilds, channels, messages, and attachments.

## CI

CI runs secret scanning with `gitleaks` against git history and the working tree.

## What is stored locally

- guild metadata
- channels and threads (one table)
- current member snapshot
- canonical message rows
- append-only message event records
- FTS index rows
- optional local embedding queue metadata and vectors

Attachment binaries are not stored in SQLite. Only attachment metadata and (optionally) extracted text.

Set `sync.attachment_text = false` if you want to keep attachment metadata and filenames but disable attachment body fetches for text indexing.

## What is sent over the wire

With remote embedding providers, message text is sent during `discrawl embed`, and search query text is sent when using `--mode semantic` or `--mode hybrid`. Stored message text is not sent during local vector scoring.

Local providers like Ollama keep both message and query embedding on the same machine.
