# `members`

Browse the offline member directory built from archived profile payloads.

## Usage

```bash
discrawl members list
discrawl members show 123456789012345678
discrawl members show --messages 10 steipete
discrawl members search "peter"
discrawl members search "github"
discrawl members search "https://github.com/steipete"
```

## Subcommands

- `list` - dump the local member directory
- `show <id|query>` - show one member; if the query resolves to one match, also show recent messages
- `search <query>` - match names plus any offline profile fields present in the archived member payload

## Flags

- `show --messages <n>` - include the most recent `n` messages from that member

## Profile fields

Extracted from the archived Discord member/user payload. May include:

- `bio`
- `pronouns`
- `location`
- `website`
- `x`
- `github`
- discovered URLs

If the bot cannot see a field from Discord, `discrawl` cannot invent it. This is strictly archive-based offline data.

## Typical workflow

```bash
discrawl sync --full
discrawl members search "design engineer"
discrawl members search "github"
discrawl members show --messages 25 steipete
discrawl messages --author steipete --days 30 --all
```
